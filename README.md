# Exploiting Software Vulnerabilities
`This was my Project 2 for CS69.17 Software Security class at Dartmouth College.`

In this project, I perform a series of software vulnerability exploits. I explore unsafe and insecure programming techniques and evaluate the efficacy of operating system defenses against them.

The software vulnerabilities exploited in this project are the following:
*Buffer Overflow to Rewrite a Return
*Buffer Overflow to Return to libc
*Format String Attack

Please refer to the write-up pdf for more details on the project and my takeaways.
